# Problem Statement
You have a random names of 1000 students in BSE and the interest is check whether the name "Patrick" is available. You are required write an algorithm that will linear search throughout the names and return the text "found" upon finding the name. Else, it will return "name not found". The algorithm will be tested on a small sample of names and the it will be generalized with names can be a very big number as "n".

### What will be running time function (T(n)) for the algorithm
### What will be the asymptotic notation of the running time function (T(n))
### What will be the best case scenario, average case scenario, and the worst case scenario.
