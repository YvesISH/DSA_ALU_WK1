## Problem Statement
You have the same 1000 students ordered in the ascending and you are required to search the same name but you are asked to used binary search. Still test the algorithm on small data set but consider big inputs as n.

#### What will be the running time function T(n) for the algorithm used.
#### Use Master's method to solve the equation and determine the time complexity in big oh notation.
#### Which algorithm performs better between part A and part B.
