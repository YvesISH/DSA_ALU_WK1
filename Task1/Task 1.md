## Peter is a data engineer in a company and advised the company to store data using linked lists instead of arrays. He insists that accessing data and removing data will be achieved with a greater performances. To test the idea, we have 10 numbers (any random numbers). The 10 numbers will be used to test performance of algorithms on arrays and linked lists.

### Write a program that will add a new element to the beginning of the array (after testing it with 10 elements generalize it with the input as n)

### Write a program that will add a new element to the beginning of the a linked list (after testing it with 10 elements generalize it with the input as n)

### Which algorithm performs better between A and B. Use the asymptotic time complexity of each algorithm to backup the answer.
